              description: >-
                Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable'
                in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate
                for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be
                usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable'
                property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally
                useful for speech.<br/><br/>
    
    
                The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number
                of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator'
                values:<br/><br/>
    
    
                1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an
                element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of
                <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values,
                referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>
    
    
                2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via
                class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a>
                property.<br/><br/>
    
    
                3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of
                the content). Use the <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>
    
    
                For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID
                references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out
                document section(s) as speakable. For this
    
                we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a> 
                which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em>
                property.

        camper vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous
        with the American English expression campground. In American English the

        A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically
        but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually
        organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class="localLink"
        href="http://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose
        data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is
        on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as
        tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>
    
    
        Specific subtypes are available for describing <a class="localLink"
        href="http://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"

        It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be
        usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate
        some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of
        the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.

            speakable:

                Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable'
                in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate
                for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be
                usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable'
                property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally
                useful for speech.<br/><br/>
    
    
                The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number
                of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator'
                values:<br/><br/>
    
    
                1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an
                element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of
                <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values,
                referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>
    
    
                2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via
                class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a>
                property.<br/><br/>
    
    
                3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of
                the content). Use the <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>
    
    
                For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID
                references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out
                document section(s) as speakable. For this
    
                we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink"
                href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a> 
                which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em>
                property.
