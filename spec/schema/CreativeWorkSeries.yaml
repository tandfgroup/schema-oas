CreativeWorkSeries:
  description: >-
    A CreativeWorkSeries in schema.org is a group of related items, typically
    but not necessarily of the same kind. CreativeWorkSeries are usually
    organized into some order, often chronological. Unlike <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/ItemList">ItemList</a> which is a general purpose
    data structure for lists of things, the emphasis with CreativeWorkSeries is
    on published materials (written e.g. books and periodicals, or media such as
    tv, radio and games).<br/><br/>


    Specific subtypes are available for describing <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/TVSeries">TVSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/RadioSeries">RadioSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/MovieSeries">MovieSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/BookSeries">BookSeries</a>, <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/Periodical">Periodical</a> and <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/VideoGameSeries">VideoGameSeries</a>. In each case,
    the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/hasPart">hasPart</a> / <a
    class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/isPartOf">isPartOf</a> properties
    can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general
    CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific
    and practical subtypes.<br/><br/>


    It is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be
    usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate
    some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of
    the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.
