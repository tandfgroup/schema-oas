        broker:
          description: >-
            An entity that arranges for an exchange between a buyer and a
            seller.  In most cases a broker never acquires or releases ownership
            of a product or service involved in an exchange.  If it is not clear
            whether an entity is a broker, seller, or buyer, the latter two
            terms are preferred.
