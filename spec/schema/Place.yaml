            A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of
            the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for
            which there is no matching property in schema.org.<br/><br/>


            Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use
            specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
            http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will
            typically expect such data to be provided using those properties,
            rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.

            An amenity feature (e.g. a characteristic or service) of the
            Accommodation. This generic property does not make a statement about

            For example, in the URL
            http://www.starbucks.co.uk/store-locator/etc/detail/3047 the code
            "3047" is a branchCode for a particular branch.
