            could include information about reporting process, methods,
            interviews, data sources, etc.

        speakable:
          description: >-
            Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable'
            in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate
            for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be
            usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable'
            property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally
            useful for speech.<br/><br/>


            The <em>speakable</em> property can be repeated an arbitrary number
            of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator'
            values:<br/><br/>


            1.) <em>id-value</em> URL references - uses <em>id-value</em> of an
            element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of
            <em>speakable</em> has (potentially relative) URL values,
            referencing identified sections of the document concerned.<br/><br/>


            2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, eg. via
            class attribute. Use the <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/cssSelector">cssSelector</a>
            property.<br/><br/>


            3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of
            the content). Use the <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/xpath">xpath</a> property.<br/><br/>


            For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID
            references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out
            document section(s) as speakable. For this

            we define a supporting type, <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/SpeakableSpecification">SpeakableSpecification</a> 
            which is defined to be a possible value of the <em>speakable</em>
            property.
