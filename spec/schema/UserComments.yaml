    UserInteraction and its subtypes is an old way of talking about users
    interacting with pages. It is generally better to use <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/Action">Action</a>-based vocabulary, alongside types
    such as <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/Comment">Comment</a>.
