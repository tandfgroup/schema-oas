            The endTime of something. For a reserved event or service (e.g.
            FoodEstablishmentReservation), the time that it is expected to end.
            For actions that span a period of time, when the action was
            performed. e.g. John wrote a book from January to
            <em>December</em>.<br/><br/>


            Note that Event uses startDate/endDate instead of startTime/endTime,
            even when describing dates with times. This situation may be
            clarified in future revisions.
