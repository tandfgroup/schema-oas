            A dateline is a brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where and when the story was written or filed though the date is often omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.

            Structured representations of dateline-related information can also be expressed more explicitly using locationCreated (which represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was written). For location depicted or described in the content, use contentLocation.

            Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some examples; "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19, 2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON CITY, Philippines".
