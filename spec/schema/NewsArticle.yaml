            A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline">dateline</a> is a
            brief piece of text included in news articles that describes where
            and when the story was written or filed though the date is often
            omitted. Sometimes only a placename is provided.<br/><br/>


            Structured representations of dateline-related information can also
            be expressed more explicitly using <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/locationCreated">locationCreated</a> (which
            represents where a work was created e.g. where a news report was
            written).  For location depicted or described in the content, use <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/contentLocation">contentLocation</a>.<br/><br/>


            Dateline summaries are oriented more towards human readers than
            towards automated processing, and can vary substantially. Some
            examples: "BEIRUT, Lebanon, June 2.", "Paris, France", "December 19,
            2017 11:43AM Reporting from Washington", "Beijing/Moscow", "QUEZON
            CITY, Philippines".
