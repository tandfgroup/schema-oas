            A technique or technology used in a <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/Dataset">Dataset</a> (or <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/DataDownload">DataDownload</a>, <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/DataCatalog">DataCatalog</a>),

            corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding
            variable(s) (described using <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a>).
            This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset
            publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended
            as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level
            summary for dataset discovery.<br/><br/>


            For example, if <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is:
            molecule concentration, <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a>
            could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry"
            or "immunofluorescence".<br/><br/>


            If the <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> is
            "depression rating", the <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a>
            could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression
            Inventory".<br/><br/>


            If there are several <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a>
            properties recorded for some given data object, use a <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/PropertyValue">PropertyValue</a> for each <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/variableMeasured">variableMeasured</a> and
            attach the corresponding <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/measurementTechnique">measurementTechnique</a>.
