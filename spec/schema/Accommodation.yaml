Accommodation:
  description: >-
    An accommodation is a place that can accommodate human beings, e.g. a hotel
    room, a camping pitch, or a meeting room. Many accommodations are for
    overnight stays, but this is not a mandatory requirement.

    For more specific types of accommodations not defined in schema.org, one can
    use additionalType with external vocabularies.
