        publishingPrinciples:
          description: >-
            The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via <a
            class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/URL">URL</a>) a document
            describing the editorial principles of an <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/Organization">Organization</a> (or
            individual e.g. a <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/Person">Person</a> writing a blog) that
            relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity
            policies. When applied to a <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> (e.g. <a
            class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a>) the principles
            are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the
            <a class="localLink"
            href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a>.<br/><br/>


            While such policies are most typically expressed in natural
            language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a <a
            class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/funder">funder</a>) can be
            expressed using schema.org terminology.

            Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the

            projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content

            The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which
            are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
                  contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates
                  areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.

        temporalCoverage:
          description: >-
            The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the
            content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or
            as a textual string indicating a time period in <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals">ISO
            8601 time interval format</a>. In
                  the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.
                  Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".
