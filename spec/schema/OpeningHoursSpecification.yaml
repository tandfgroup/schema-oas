    A structured value providing information about the opening hours of a place
    or a certain service inside a place.<br/><br/>


    The place is <strong>open</strong> if the <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/opens">opens</a> property is specified, and
    <strong>closed</strong> otherwise.<br/><br/>


    If the value for the <a class="localLink"
    href="http://schema.org/closes">closes</a> property is less than the value
    for the <a class="localLink" href="http://schema.org/opens">opens</a>
    property then the hour range is assumed to span over the next day.
